== Activating the connection

The changes weâ€™ve made to the connection `+ethernet1+` have not been
activated.

Run the `+nmcli con up+` command to activate the static connection that
you configured in the previous step:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmcli con up ethernet1
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
Connection successfully activated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/7)
----

Run the following to check the ip address and dhcp settings are
correctly configured.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmstatectl show eth1 | grep -A 10 ipv4
----

.configuredstatic
image::configuredstatic-2.png[configuredstatic]

You can see that the address is configured with `+192.168.122.110/32+`
with `+dhcp+` set to `+false+`, as expected.

Enter the following to check the default gateway.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
nmstatectl show | grep -A 10 routes
----

.defaultgw

The final step is to learn how to configure the DNS server addresses for
the connection.
