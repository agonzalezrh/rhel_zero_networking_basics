== Activating the connection

The changes weâ€™ve made to the connection `+ethernet1+` have not been
activated.

Run the `+nmcli con up+` command to activate the static connection that
you configured in the previous step:

[source,bash]
----
nmcli con up ethernet1
----

Run the following to check the ip address and dhcp settings are
correctly configured.

[source,bash]
----
nmstatectl show enp7s0 | grep -A 10 ipv4
----

.configuredstatic
image::../assets/images/configuredstatic.png[configuredstatic]

You can see that the address is configured with `+192.168.122.110/32+`
with `+dhcp+` set to `+false+`, as expected.

Enter the following to check the default gateway.

[source,bash]
----
nmstatectl show | grep -A 10 routes
----

.defaultgw

The final step is to learn how to configure the DNS server addresses for
the connection.
